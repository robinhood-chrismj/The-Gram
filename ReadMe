I've been working on this for the past 2 days. 
I've got a working extension that auto-sends "The Telegram Logo" with an interval that can be taken as input from the user.

How to get it running:

1) Download the folder attached.
2) Go to the extensions tab in your Chromium Browser and enable developer mode.
3) Click Load Unpacked and select the folder downloaded.
4) The extension should appear on the top, press and enable by clicking on the slider.
5) Set the appropriate time interval.
6) Enjoy!
